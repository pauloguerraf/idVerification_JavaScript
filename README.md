# ID Number verification

A web app put together to check Ecuadorian ID numbers against a list of IDs that were submitted supporting a petition for a popular referendum about the future of Yasuni National Park and Reserve. 
The mentioned IDs were wrongly rejected, stopping the petition from being accepted.

This project was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

I used the [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/) Front End Framework to develop the web interface a little bit faster.

The helpful [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) method was used to filter the array of ID numbers, based on the user input.

Once 10 digits are typed and the search button is clicked a message is displayed to inform the user about the results and if further actions are needed.

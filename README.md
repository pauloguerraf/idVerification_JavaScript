# ID Number verification

A web app put together to check Ecuadorian ID numbers against a list of IDs that were rejected as part of a petition for a popular referendum regarding the future of Ecuador's Yasuni National Park and Reserve. 
The mentioned IDs were ilegally rejected, stopping the petition from being accepted.

This project was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

The [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/) fron-end framework was used to speed up the development of the web interface.

The helpful [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) method was used to filter the ID numbers array based on user input.

Once 10 digits are typed and the search button is clicked a message is displayed to inform the user about the results and if further actions are needed. 

Code was bundled using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

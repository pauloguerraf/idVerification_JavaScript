# idVerification_JavaScript
A web app put together to check Ecuadorian ID numbers against a list of IDs that were submitted supporting a petition for a popular referendum about the future of Yasuni National Park and Reserve. 
The mentioned IDs were wrongly rejected, stopping the petition from being accepted.

This project was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
